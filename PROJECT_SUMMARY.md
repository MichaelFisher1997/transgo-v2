# Project Summary

This project is a personal media library application that allows users to explore their movies and TV shows.

## Key Features and Changes:

* **TV Show Component Testing:**
    * Fixed nil pointer dereference issues in TV show component tests
    * Improved mock data generation for seasons with proper string formatting
    * Added proper context initialization for templ component rendering
    * All test cases now pass including complete data and missing poster scenarios

* **Theme Toggle Implementation:**
    * Successfully implemented a dark mode/light mode toggle functionality.
    * The JavaScript logic for theme toggling has been embedded directly into `app/views/layouts/base.templ` to ensure it's always available.
    * The theme toggle button is present in the navigation bar and correctly applies the `dark` class to the `html` element.
    * Basic dark mode styling has been applied to the `body` element in `app/static/css/styles.css` for a simple color scheme.
    * Removed the Nordic theme specific styles and the separate JavaScript file for `theme-toggle.js`.

* **Static File Serving:**
    * The application now embeds static files (like CSS) using `go:embed` and serves them via `http.FileServer(http.FS(staticFiles))`. This ensures static assets are reliably served.

* **Dockerization:**
    * The application is containerized using Docker, with `docker-compose.yml` managing the services.
    * The `Dockerfile` has been updated to correctly build and run the Go application, including embedding static assets.

## Current Status:

The TV show component is now fully tested and working as expected. The theme toggle functionality is working with a basic color scheme. The application is containerized and ready for further development.
